First, something I forgot earlier, and just realized it now when I looked at NHL. I need another column to be inserted right after col. E "DAY". It will be named "FAV", 
and it will have 2 values: "H" for Home favorite, or "V" for Visitor favorite. It is the same thing as col. D in Soccer.
[11/22/2012 9:56:03 PM] Dragan: All information is located on http://www.covers.com/sports/nba/nba_main.aspx.
[11/22/2012 9:57:59 PM] Dragan: When I extract the scores manually, I always go to http://scores.covers.com/basketball-scores-matchups.aspx, click on "Matchup", 
and then compare those 2 teams.
[11/22/2012 10:07:11 PM] Dragan: So, this is NBA project. The NBA link on covers.com is exactly the same as NHL link, so all the info will be stored at their same respective places.
[11/22/2012 10:12:39 PM] Dragan: 1. For NHL: insert col. "FAV" after col. E (col. E-I will be: DAY, FAV, CON, B2B, AFT).
[11/22/2012 10:16:51 PM] Dragan: 2. After you make this change to NHL, col. A-I in the NBA will be exactly the same as in NHL.
[11/22/2012 10:21:20 PM] Dragan: 3. Col. R-W in the NBA are exactly the same as col. K-P in NHL.
[11/22/2012 10:22:18 PM] Dragan: 4. Col. Y-AB in the NBA are exactly the same as col. R-U in the NHL.
[11/22/2012 10:24:07 PM] Dragan: 5. Col. AM-AP in the NBA are exactly the same as col. W-Z in the NHL.
[11/22/2012 10:28:52 PM] Dragan: 6. Col. AQ-AT in the NBA are exactly the same as col. AA-AD in the NHL.
[11/22/2012 10:31:55 PM] Dragan: NOTE: In the NHL file I'm sending you I have just added "FAV" in col. F, and deleted the emptly col. AA ( it used to be "B5", and now it's "VVO"). 
This is the way I would like it to be. So probably all columns after col. F are messed up.
[11/22/2012 10:53:50 PM] Dragan: So this leaves us with col. K-P, and AD-AK in the NBA.
[11/22/2012 11:09:34 PM] Dragan: 7. In the NBA, col. K-P will look into Home wins, or Visitor wins. Not game wins, but "Line" wins (or who won the "Spread"). 
For example, if you go to http://www.covers.com/pageLoader/pageLoader.aspx?page=/data/nba/teams/pastresults/2012-2013/team404085.html, you will find the information under "ATL Line".
[11/22/2012 11:13:17 PM] Dragan: Col. K-P are very similar to col. R-W, except that R-W is dealing with Over-Under, and K-P is dealing with Home-Visitor won the line.
[11/22/2012 11:15:58 PM] Dragan: Col. K-P are also dealing with matchups between "today's" opponents only. Just like col. R-W.
[11/22/2012 11:20:17 PM] Dragan: Col. K - How many games in a row did the home team win the line? (So again, this has nothing to do with who won the game, 
but only who beat the line.....or won the spead.) If the home team did not win the line last game (the visitor won), then leave it blank.
[11/22/2012 11:22:02 PM] Dragan: Col. L - How many games in a row did the visiting team beat the line?
[11/22/2012 11:24:24 PM] Dragan: NOTE: When I do manually col. K-P, I go to http://www.covers.com/pageLoader/pageLoader.aspx?page=/data/nba/matchups/g5_summary_1.html, 
and choose table "A LOOK BACK". This gives me games between today's opponents only. But I don't think you are going to use this table.
[11/22/2012 11:26:11 PM] Dragan: Col. M - How many games in a row did the home team win the line but only when today's home team was also home, 
and today's visiting team was also visitor?
[11/22/2012 11:27:52 PM] Dragan: Col. N - How many games in a row did the visiting team win the line but only when today's home team was home and the visiting team was visitor?
[11/22/2012 11:28:34 PM] Dragan: Col. M-N: If a team lost the last game, leave it blank always.
[11/22/2012 11:32:53 PM] Dragan: Col. O-P is looking into the last 5 games. If home team won 3 and visiting team won 2, then Col. O should have "3", and Col. P "blank". 
And vice versa. So Col. O is Home, Col. P is Visitor, and who ever won more put the value there (3,4, or 5), and the other column is blank.
[11/22/2012 11:38:30 PM] Dragan: Col. AD-AK are similar to Col. AM-AT, except the AM-AT deal with O-U, and AD-AK with Win or Lose the "Line".
[11/22/2012 11:39:46 PM] Dragan: Col. AD - How many games in a row did the Visitor win the Line? Regardless of who the opponent is.
[11/22/2012 11:40:12 PM] Dragan: Col. AE - How many games in a row did the Home team win the Line? Regardless of who the opponent is.
[11/22/2012 11:41:24 PM] Dragan: CORRECTION FOR COL. AE: How many games in a row did the Visiting team lose the Line? Regardless of who the opponent is.
[11/22/2012 11:41:44 PM] Dragan: Col. AF - How many games in a row did the Home team win the Line?
[11/22/2012 11:42:08 PM] Dragan: Col. How many games in a row did the Home team lose the Line?
[11/22/2012 11:42:44 PM] Dragan: That was for Col. AG.
[11/22/2012 11:45:49 PM] Dragan: Co. AH-AK: The same as Col. AD-AG, except only the games where today's home team was also home, and today's visiting team 
was also visitor should be counted.

[11/26/2012 8:19:10 PM] Dragan: This is going to be different. Betexplorer.com is a european website and they use decimals: 2.10, 2.12...etc.
[11/26/2012 8:21:26 PM] Dragan: Americans don't use decimals, and since covers.com is an american website, the best way to determine the favorite is by using spread/points.
[11/26/2012 8:31:29 PM] Dragan: EXAMPLE: If you go to http://scores.covers.com/basketball-scores-matchups.aspx, the first game will be SA - WAS. In that same box, on to the right there is a column "Odds", first value "191", and below that "5". Always take the bottom value, in this case "5". Upper value is Over/Under 191 points, and that should be ignored.
[11/26/2012 8:32:00 PM] Dragan: If the value is positive, the team is NOT the favorite. If the value is negative, the team IS the favorite.
[11/26/2012 8:32:56 PM] Dragan: In this case, SA is the favorite.
[11/26/2012 8:35:51 PM] Dragan: Another example, the game POR - DET, the value in the column "Odds", is "-1.5". In this case, DET is the favorite, and POR is not.
[11/26/2012 8:39:24 PM] Dragan: NOTE: Not sure if you know this, the team in the upper row is the guest team, and the team in lower row is the home team. For example, SA is the guest, and WAS is the home team. It actually says:"San Antonio at Washington".
[11/26/2012 8:40:23 PM] Dragan: Let me know if you can use this. If not, I'll figure out another way.
